    "### What is the problem you are solving?\n",
    "The core problem is the unobtrusive monitoring of human health and safety. Manual monitoring of elderly patients or high-risk workers is expensive and intrusive. By using smartphone telemetry, we can solve this by building a system that automatically distinguishes between sedentary (Sitting, Standing) and active (Walking, Climbing) behaviors. This enables automated alerts for \"lack of movement\" or identifying \"fall risks\" without the need for cameras or constant human supervision."
